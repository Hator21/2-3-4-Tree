This is a simple implementation of a 2-3-4 tree in Java as a Set, which is a Be-Tree
of order 4.

The structure implements the Simple Set interface (SSet.java) from Dr. Pat Morin's
wonderful *Open Data Structures* book.

DefaultComparator.java and TwoFourNodeException.java are only helpers. The bulk of
the datastructure is found in TwoFourTree.java.

I've tried to document the code as best as possible and be clear in every choice I
made.

TODO: 
> rewrite the recursive delete method as an iterative one.
